## Requirements

To run blueJaysApp, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Django 3.x
- Virtualenv (recommended for creating isolated Python environments)

---

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run blueJaysApp:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the Homebase repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/homebase.git
cd homebase
```

### 2. Navigate to the blueJaysApp Directory

Navigate to the blueJaysApp directory within the Homebase repository:

```shell
cd blueJaysApp
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. To create one, run:

```shell
python -m venv venv_homebase
source venv_homebase/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv_homebase\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

blueJaysApp should now be running locally. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

blueJaysApp may use environment variables for configuration. You can set these in a `.env` file in the project's root directory or configure them directly in your server environment.

Here are the possible environment variables that you may need to configure, depending on your specific use case:

- `SECRET_KEY`: Django secret key for security.
- `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development and `False` for production.

### Customization

You can customize blueJaysApp by modifying templates, static files, and adding your own application logic. Refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) for more details on customization.

## Usage

Document how users can use your application, specifically blueJaysApp. Include information about:

- How to interact with APIs and fetch/display baseball-related data.
- Any other relevant features and functionality.

Provide code examples and screenshots if possible to make it easy for users to understand how to use BlueJaysApp.
